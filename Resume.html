            <p>I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life. By the time I changed my mind about that, my liaison with the applied sciences had drastically altered my worldview already. This still informs much of my work and work ethic - design is no less
                of a science in my eyes than physics or computing. (In other words, I like design as long as I can be a nerd about it.)</p>
